You may get an error that says "ImportError: Keras requires TensorFlow 2.2 or higher. Install TensorFlow via ‘pip install tensorflow’"  When trying to import keras

This most times happens with windows OS

Installing "Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable" will fix the issue.

Close all Anaconda / Spyder windows, then install the above setup file.

Once installation is complete , restart your computer. Start >> 'Restart'. (Make sure to do 'restart' itself. A shutdown and start may not work sometimes)

Then launch spyder and check the program.
